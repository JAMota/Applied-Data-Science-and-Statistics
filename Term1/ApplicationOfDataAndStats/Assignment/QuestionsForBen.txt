Questions for Ben:

- to which degree should I comment my code
- what is his prefered way of leaving out the answer? should I leave it in a print, should I just let the 
answer be there or should I type it out in a comment or in markdown text?
- is there a problem if I just overengineered some of questions by fully automating it?
- how much of the though process and more importantly how much of output when doing certain tasks that, 
does not get automatically previwed should I show from my steps (Exercise A (2.iii) for reference)
