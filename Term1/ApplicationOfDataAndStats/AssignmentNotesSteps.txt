step 1 graph

step 2 model

step 3 diagnotic

step 4 refine model

step 5 diagnostic on the new model

step 6 refine model again until we have a good balance

each of the sentence explaining what and why you are each step

Regression Analysis
1. Graph (Sentences, Explain what it tells u)
    * Optimization
2. Fit your model
3. Diagnolstic (QQ plot, Residual plot)
4. Refine the model
5. Intrepretation

how we have arrived to our solution, how we have justified that choice
