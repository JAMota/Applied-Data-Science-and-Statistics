since pythong and R are designed to analyze complete and tidy data
don't be afraid to use excel to do some data checking

sometimes the data isn't completly independent
meaning that linear models will be biased and not properly work

using the flags on glm we can do the auto regression to account for that

the residuals are just as important as the model
if we are analysing covid the residuals give us the seasonality and trends

sine and cosine functions are for reading frequencies
