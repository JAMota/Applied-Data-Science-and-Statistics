## Question 5




You can add options to executable code like this

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
  
summary(ozone)

```
Here we can see that wind and ozone have some pretty extremely high max values compared to both the median 

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    

ggpairs(ozone,
        lower = list(continuous = "smooth"),
        diag=list(continuous = "barDiag"),
        axisLabels= "show")


```
Firstly, as it can be observed in the graph that ozone has a very significant positive skewness and is possibly normally distributed.

We can also observe that ozone have a good correlation with temperature with only a small amount of variance overall with the exception of a few points between the 3rd quartile and the maximum, we can also see that there is a a positive slope meaning that as temperature increases the amount of ozone detected increases as well. 

Furthermore, radiation has a correlation with a positive slope with ozone, the variance is more extreme between the 2nd quartile and maximum but maintaining a relatively low variance between the minimum and the 2nd quartile.

Lastly, Wind's correlation with ozone has a negative slope

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    



```
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    



```
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    



```
