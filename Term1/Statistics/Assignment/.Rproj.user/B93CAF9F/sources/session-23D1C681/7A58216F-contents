## Question 5




You can add options to executable code like this

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
  
summary(ozone)

```
Here we can see that wind and ozone have some pretty extremely high max values compared to both the median 

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    

ggpairs(ozone,
        lower = list(continuous = "smooth"),
        diag=list(continuous = "barDiag"),
        axisLabels= "show")


```
Firstly, as it can be observed in the graph that ozone has a very significant positive skewness and is possibly normally distributed.

We can also observe that ozone have a good correlation with temperature with only a small amount of variance overall with the exception of a few points between the 3rd quartile and the maximum, we can also see that there is a a positive slope meaning that as temperature increases the amount of ozone detected increases as well. 

Furthermore, radiation has a correlation with a positive slope with ozone so radiation has a positive effect on ozone. The variance is more extreme between the 2nd quartile and maximum but maintaining a relatively low variance between the minimum and the 2nd quartile.

Lastly, Wind's correlation with ozone has a negative slope, meaning that has wind increases the less ozone is detected. Most of the variance below the line of best fit, is between the first and third quartile while the values that are more on the extreme, between the the minimum and 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile and the maximum are almost all above the line of best fit.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    
model = lm(ozone ~ radiation + temperature + wind, data = ozone)

summary(model)

#First thing we can observe is the confidence intervals of the 3 variables, both the temperature and wind have confidence intervals of 99,9% as it can be see by the 3 stars next to their respective p-values, radiation is in the 95% confidence interval but is close to the 99% confidence interval.

##we can observe that the intercept so when  	

##residuals are the values of the differences between
## the line we made and the observations

## the coefficients are the point estimations
## intercept is the beta0 and the wt is the beta1

## the PR(>lt) is the same as the confidence interval
## if it has *** stars is inside the 99,9%
## ** is inside the 99% confidence interval and
## * is the standard 95% confidence interval


```
$\beta0 = \beta1$
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
    



```

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}
