#First thing we can observe is the confidence intervals of the 3 variables, both the temperature and wind have confidence intervals of 99,9% as it can be see by the 3 stars next to their respective p-values, radiation is in the 95% confidence interval but is close to the 99% confidence interval.
##we can observe that the intercept so when  	$\beta0 = \beta1$
##residuals are the values of the differences between
## the line we made and the observations
## the coefficients are the point estimations
## intercept is the beta0 and the wt is the beta1
## the PR(>lt) is the same as the confidence interval
## if it has *** stars is inside the 99,9%
## ** is inside the 99% confidence interval and
## * is the standard 95% confidence interval
##we can observe that the intercept so when  	$\beta0 = \beta1$
