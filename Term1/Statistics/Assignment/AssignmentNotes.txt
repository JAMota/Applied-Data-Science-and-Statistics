use the method of moments ignore the  Rayleigh distribution question 3

question 1 

b) we assume that the wife has blue eyes

c) knowing that the first child has brown eyes, what does that change the probability of 
aron having blue eyes gene

Q2

we always have to consider the 359 mps because the 2 candidates will not be voting
each mp behaves independently 

Remember we never have to make the exact answer we need to do compute those probabilities

c) things can change 14 times (each every day) at the end day 1 there is ratio and then 
at the end of day 2 there will a different ratio and so on

d) instead of stoppping at the end of day 14 we go till day 60

Q3
a)
use the method of moments ignore the Rayleigh distribution question 3


e) all you need is that the sample mean is 3.2 and the number of samples is 150

4

find the pdf using it's properties to find the constant k and then the only 
unkown paramenteris the parameter of the function which we have to find using we have 
to use a maximum likelihoods

b) we don't have to solve and proceed after the quadratric equantion

c) we have to adjust the code in the hint to proper equation

5 (all in R so we have to write a lot of what we can see, why we did it and other
explanations and not just the code, don't forget to also show the output)
(also include all the plots)

b) give explanationa around the model that we have fit
