## Very important documentation for the 2018 data set //it is a supprise toll that will help us later
technicalAnnex2018 = 'https://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/8406/mrdoc/pdf/8406_cyber_security_breaches_survey_2018_technical_annex.pdf'

## this is the loading the first year of this level of survey data set 
dataCyberSecuritySurvey2018 = read_spss('C:/AppliedDataScienceAndStatistics/Applied-Data-Science-and-Statistics/Term1/WorkingWithData/Assignment1/Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 2018/UKDA-8406-spss-CyberSurvey2018/spss/spss24/17-054294-01_csbs_2018_final_data_deidentified_v1_12042018_public.sav')

## adding the variable year because none of the data sets have any proper way to distinguish between the years of each survey
dataCyberSecuritySurvey2018$year = '2018'

##renaming all the bloody variables to a more java like name

dataCyberSecuritySurvey2018TidyName <- rename(dataCyberSecuritySurvey2018,isBusiness= 'samptype')

## terrible boolean pratice but if isBusiness is 1 it is a business if it is 2 it is a charity

##dataCyberSecuritySurvey2018TidyName

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
