Q1: what is considered neat, reproducible  code?

Q2: is it bothersome to have too many comments some even a bit personal or should I remove them in the final version?


looking for evidence that we have engaged with the lectured material multiple imputation, graphs, etc

get the file download it form the onedrive just because it is neat

Q: I have a question about the quarto pdf exportation, if I wanted to do a table of content for indexing all my report topics and code would that count for the 8 page limit?

Have a look at how to import the data without labels to R using the read_spps

remember to make the variables as factors (as.factor(var)) instead of numeric because one isn't just bigger than the others
Instead of making a huge complex variable that computes all the outcomes work with multiple binary that cover most of outcomes
post effect for comparing (attack types/outcomes) and costs

the linearity may not be mantained after the como«putation of the values
