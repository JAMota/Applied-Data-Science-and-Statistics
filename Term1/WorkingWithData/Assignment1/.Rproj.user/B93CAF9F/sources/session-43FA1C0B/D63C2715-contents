  abstract  = "Two classes of modern missing data procedures, maximum
               likelihood (ML) and multiple imputation (MI), tend to yield
               similar results when implemented in comparable ways. In either
               approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely
               for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A
               simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and
               benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of
               auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes
               liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the
               inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive
               strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently
               omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the
               possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency
               and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in
               currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage
               the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes
               it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.",

               investigate if the graduates of the BEEd program of Bataan
               Peninsula State University Dinalupihan Campus have met the
               expectations provided in CMO No. 74 series of 2017. This study
               uses an explanatory-sequential design which is a two-phase
               approach, where quantitative results of the study, from
               collected quantitative data using a survey questionnaire in
               phase 1 were followed up and supported by qualitative data
               collected in phase 2 to further explain the findings. The
               results of the study indicate that significant difference is
               evident in the competency of the respondents based on the
               expected competencies as stated at CMO No. 74, series of 2017 in

               grouped accordingly, as provided by the p-values which are

               graduates confidently believes that they possess the
