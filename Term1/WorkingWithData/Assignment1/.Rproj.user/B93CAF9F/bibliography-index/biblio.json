In either approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.",

This study aims to investigate if the graduates of the BEEd program of Bataan Peninsula State University Dinalupihan Campus have met the expectations provided in CMO No. 74 series of 2017. This study uses an explanatory-sequential design which is a two-phase approach, where quantitative results of the study, from collected quantitative data using a survey questionnaire in phase 1 were followed up and supported by qualitative data collected in phase 2 to further explain the findings. The results of the study indicate that significant difference is evident in the competency of the respondents based on the expected competencies as stated at CMO No. 74, series of 2017 in terms of in-depth understanding of learners; pedagogical content knowledge; assessment and evaluation; communication, higher order thinking, and technology; attributes of model teacher; personal and professional development; when respondents have grouped accordingly, as provided by the p-values which are statistically lesser than the alpha of .05. In general, graduates confidently believes that they possess the competencies stated and describe in CMO No. 74 s. 2017, their Cooperating Teachers and Coordinators, however, based on their qualitative responses, pointed out that there are still areas of competencies that are needed to be developed among the graduates. The result of the study indicates that the institution should revisit the program implementation of CMO No. 46 s. 2012, focusing on competencies stated in CMO No. 74 s. 2017.
