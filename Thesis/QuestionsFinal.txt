Questions:

Since we have the model assumptions in the introduction, when does it make sense to start talking about the prototype

On the data collectiom or any other section does it make sense to make reference to the appendix (yes, we can say more details on appendix A,B)
in the appendix do not include the output of the code

Ask for any resource to properly explain quantitative analysis modeling (look for applied papers, RSSC)

On the conclusion we can talk about the limitations and future extensions like stability, modeling each steps , relaxing the D assumptions

presentation :
measure the efficenecy trhought queuing theoery - equations - equations used and final results


ASK: How sensitive are your results to the method used/
assumptions made? How do your results relate to those in the literature, which may use different
methods? 


I have estimated the service time and I have realised one of the assumptions were not correct, how do I write about that problem?


write about unstable rho AKA >1 (in data analysis)

Detailed review of literature on which project is based, Description of methodology, underlying
theory, : look up what are the data pipeline processing, extra chapter about this

subections: on what each parameter of the queueing theory means

Research qustion: measure and effiency measure of the pipeline (and motivation, use what I had in the form) (better utilize computacional resources)


make figures with both the exploratory analysis of the heart data and the parameters of mu and lambda


What further
research do you think is needed? e.g. additional data, methodological developments : linking to other useful things to measure
