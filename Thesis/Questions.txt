Since we have the model assumptions in the introduction, when does it make sense to start talking about the prototype

On the data collectiom or any other section does it make sense to make reference to the appendix (yes, we can say more details on appendix A,B)
in the appendix do not include the output of the code

Ask for any resource to properly explain quantitative analysis modeling (look for applied papers, RSSC)

On the conclusion we can talk about the limitations and future extensions like stability, modeling each steps , relaxing the D assumptions
