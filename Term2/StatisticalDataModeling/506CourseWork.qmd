## For the love of god don't forget

Do not display too much raw R output (e.g. don't display the full output
of 'summary(model)'), but edit this down to the essentials. Ensure to
include justification for each step of your analyses, providing comments
alongside your R code to explain what you are doing and add appropriate
titles and labelled axes to your plots.

## Question 1

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72), echo=FALSE}

load("C:/AppliedDataScienceAndStatistics/Applied-Data-Science-and-Statistics/Term2/StatisticalDataModeling/datasets_exercises_Assessment.RData")

```

We have the model:

$Yi$ ~ $N(\frac{\theta1xi}{\theta2 + xi}$, $\sigma^2)$

## Question 1 a)

Due to the visible non-linearity of the model, we would be required to
significantly transform our data to get a linear model that would have
an acceptable fit of the data. We can also see that the response data
seems to be only positive while a normal distribution goes from
]-$\infty$,$\infty$[ . Such arbitrary transformation increases the
complexity of the model, making it less interpretable and not respect
the nature of the data.

Linear regression models are based on the assumption that the
relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
If the relationship between the variables is non-linear, a linear
regression model may not be appropriate to use. In such cases,
transforming the data to make the relationship linear may not result in
an accurate representation of the true relationship, and can lead to
overfitting or underfitting. Additionally, transforming the data can
result in a loss of interpretability of the results, as it can be
difficult to understand the meaning of the transformed variables.

Another issue with using a linear regression model for non-linear data
is that the residuals, which represent the difference between the
observed and predicted values, may not be normally distributed, which is
another assumption of linear regression models. This can lead to biased
or incorrect results.

In conclusion, when the data is non-linear, a linear regression model
may not be the best choice for modelling the relationship between the
variables, and alternative methods need to be considered.

// make a graph to show the data is not linear

<!-- //should I talk about the increase in variance or is it only topic 2? Not really because we don't have enough data at the start of the graph -->

## Question 1 b)

The Yi are independent so the likelihood is a product of the individual
pdfs.

## TODO GET BETTER WORDING FOR THE REPLACE PART 

<!-- $Y$ ~ $N(\frac{\theta1 xi}{\theta2+xi}, \sigma^2)$ -->

Likelihood of a normal distribution where $L(\mu,\sigma^2,x1...xn)$ = 

= $\Pi^n_{i=1} fX(xi,\mu,\sigma^2)$

= $\Pi^n_{i=1} (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}* exp{(-\frac{1}{2} * \frac{xi - \mu}{\sigma^2})}$ =

= $(2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} * exp{(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{n} (xi-\mu)^2)}$

Replacing the $\mu$ with the respective $\theta s$ and n, we have the likelihood as:

$L(\beta0,\beta1,\sigma^2;x,y)$ = 

= $\prod_{i=1}^{n}$ $p(\beta0,\beta1,\sigma^2;x,y)$ = 

= $(2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{100}{2}} * exp{(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{100}(xi-\frac{\theta1xi}{\theta2+xi})^2)}$


The log-likelihood of a normal distribution is:

$l(\mu,\sigma^2,x1...xn)$ =

= $ln(L(\mu,\sigma^2,x1...xn))$ =

= $ln((2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} * exp{(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{n} (xi-\mu)^2)})$ =

= $ln((2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}}) + ln(exp{(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{n} (xi-\mu)^2)})$ =

= $-\frac{n}{2}ln(2\pi\sigma^2) -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{n} (xi-\mu)^2)$ =

= $-\frac{n}{2}ln(2\pi) -\frac{n}{2}ln(\sigma^2) -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{n} (xi-\mu)^2)$

Once again replacing the $\mu$ with the respective $\theta s$ and n, we have the log-likelihood as:

$l(\beta0,\beta1,\sigma^2;x,y)$ =

= $-\frac{100}{2}ln(2\pi) -\frac{100}{2}ln(\sigma^2) -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{100} (xi-\frac{\theta1xi}{\theta2+xi})^2)$ =

= $-50ln(2\pi) -50ln(\sigma^2) -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}* \sum_{i=1}^{100} (xi-\frac{\theta1xi}{\theta2+xi})^2)$

## Question 1 c)

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}

n = nrow(nlmodel)



### Create a function to evaluate minus the log-likelihood
myLike = function(theta0,theta1,sigma){
  
# Log-likelihood
result = -n/2*log(2*pi) -n/2*log(sigma^2) -0.5*(sigma^2) * sum((nlmodel$y*theta1)/(theta2+nlmodel$x))
  

# Returning negative log-likelihood
return(-result)
}

```

## Question 1 d)

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=72)}

# Estimating the MLE
out <- nlm(myLike,
  p = c(1,1,1),
  hessian = T,
  iterlim = 10000,
  steptol = 1e-10)

# Reporting estimates
out$estimate

```

## Question 2

Model 1:

$Yi$ ~ $Pois(\lambda i)$

$log(\lambda i) = \beta0 + \beta1 xi$

Model 2:

$Yi$ ~ $N(\mu i,\sigma^2)$

$log(\mu i) = \gamma0 +\gamma1 xi$

## Question 2 a)

As we can from the graph and what we can determine from the nature of
the data represented in such graph the recorded number of AIDS cases is
a count variable and the counts are non-negative integers.

The first model, a Poisson distribution, would be a more appropriate
choice. The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that models
count data which respects the nature of the data

The second model, a Normal distribution, would not be the best fit since
its range is from ]-$\infty$,$\infty$[ and expects continuous values,
not respecting the nature of the data.

The log-link function in both models ensures that the predicted values
are always positive. // redo this pls

## Question 2 b)

The Yi are independent so the likelihood is a product of the individual
pdfs.
