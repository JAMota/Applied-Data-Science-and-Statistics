In the assignment she wants us to check the class specific performance and accuracy not just
the overall model performance

For vector machines, make sure the data is only factors
it is important to try multiple kernerls for non linear data
if it is linear, we will have to improve it by using cross validation

comment on the summary: explain what you can see (without just picking values)

how the classification method classifies the data: explain how the theory works on my own words
description based on the lecture material, not just googled the answer (might be good to refer 
to the slide examples)

set the seed and output so dorka can verify our answer
