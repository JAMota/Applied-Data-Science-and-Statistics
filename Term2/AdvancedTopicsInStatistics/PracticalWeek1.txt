When we have a problem where we know the distribution, the number of cases, number of positive results and 
unkown probability this unknown probability (theta) can be considered a random variable with its own
distribution.

We will be using simulations to build up distributions to approximate posteriority distribution.

steps: 
1 data model, making the distribution Y ~ Binom(10, 0.5)
2 ()
3 quantities of interest P(Y >= 8)
